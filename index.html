        <p>I'm from Sweden. image I'm currently studying at Medieinstitutet to become a fullstack developer. Between my job as a master data administrator for the food industry and school, I'm deep into Home Assistant and love home automation. When I'm not writing code, I can be found in the kitchen cooking or baking 👨‍🍳, renovating the house 🔨, enjoying a videogame 🎮, or spending time with my two daughters and lovely partner.</p>
